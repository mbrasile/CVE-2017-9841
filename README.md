# CVE-2017-9841
CVE-2017-9841 detector script by Massimiliano Brasile

CVE-2017-9841 ( https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2017-9841/ ) refers to the possibility to execute remote code on every application that use a bugged version of phpunit/phpunit ( before 4.8.28 and 5.x before 5.6.3 ). So this issue has impact on main php CMSs (Prestashop, Wordpress, Drupal, ..) and their plugins, in case they use it. To help to find these backdoors it is necessary to check for every inclusion of this testing framework in every folder of your CMS, so I wrote this little script to quickly check all servers of my clients.

How to use

1. copy the bash script in your web root folder
2. execute as root (e.g. sudo ./cve_phpunit.sh) or at least with the right privileges to read all folders and files
3. wait for the recursively scan end and it will search for the existence of any phpunit/phpunit folder showing for each of them if it looks safe or bugged
