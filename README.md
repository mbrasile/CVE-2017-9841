# CVE-2017-9841
CVE-2017-9841 detector script by Massimiliano Brasile

CVE-2017-9841 ( https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2017-9841/ ) refers to the possibility to execute remote code on every application using a bugged version of phpunit/phpunit ( before 4.8.28 and 5.x before 5.6.3 ). Since phpunit is a famous framework it looks this issue has impact on main php CMSs (Prestashop, Wordpress, Drupal, ..) and their plugins, in case they use it. To help to find these backdoors it is mandatory to check for any inclusion of this testing framework in every subfolder of your web root, so I wrote this little quick&dirty script to check all the instances of Prestashop or Wordpress I am in charge of.

How to use

1. copy the bash script in your web root folder (e.g. /var/www/html)
2. execute as root (e.g. sudo ./cve_phpunit.sh) or at least with the right privileges to read all folders and files
3. wait for the recursively scan end and in case of occurrences, it will show for any phpunit/phpunit folder found if it looks a safe or bugged version

NOTE: in case of bugged version occurence of phpunit instances, update if possible or remove them if they lack support from their developer
